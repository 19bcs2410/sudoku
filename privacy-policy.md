**Cookies**

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.



This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.



**Personalized Advertisements**

We aim to provide personalized ads in our services using third-party advertising networks. However, if you are in the European Economic Area, Norway or Switzerland, some of our third-party advertising networks, will rely on your consent to process Personal Data in order to provide personalized advertising to you, therefore you will be asked whether you consent to the collection of your mobile device advertising identifier and IP address so that they can provide a personalized advertisement experience.

To opt-out or withdraw your consent from receiving personalized advertisements, see the "Opt-out of targeted advertising" section below.

- Your rights and options

You have the rights to opt-out of targeted advertising. To provide you with better tailored ads in apps/games, we use third-party advertising networks and their partners. To do so they use personal and non-personal information such as advertising identifiers, such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising (IDFA), and/or other tracking technologies to enable and optimize this advertising procedure.

You can opt-out from personalized advertisement experience, through the following ways.

For iOS Devices:

Open Settings

Select Privacy

Select Advertising and enable "Limit Ad Tracking" (iOS 13 and older versions); Or select Tracking and turn off "Allow Apps to Request to Track" (iOS 14)

For Android Devices:

Open Settings

Select Google

Select Ads and enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization"

After opting out, advertising networks will consider this choice as a withdrawal of consent to personalized advertisement experience and they will show contextual advertisements and not personalized advertisements based on your interests. Note: Regardless of your choice and/or your device settings, you will continue to see non-customized advertising and you may continue to receive personalized ads from our third-party ad networks that obtain your consent on other apps and/or websites.



**Security**

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.



**Links to Other Sites**

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.



**Children’s Privacy**

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
